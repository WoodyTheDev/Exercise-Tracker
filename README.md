## Project status
It is not polished and would take a lot of time to make it presentable. In my opinion is the project idea not good enough. I would need to change it so that users would actually want to use it. Also I would need linux cloud machine that i dont have. Maybe in the future i will migrate the portfolio site to a linux cloud machine and add the Exercise Tracker to it. But for now, enjoy the code!
